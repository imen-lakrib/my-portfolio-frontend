                I'm a web developer specializing in the #MERN-stack.
                My love for learning is a distinguishing feature,
                and programming offers endless learning opportunities,
                making it the perfect fit for me. I've enjoyed exploration
                and problem-solving since childhood, and this curiosity
                has driven my learning journey for the past seven years.
                <br />

                I pursued a master's degree in Corporate Finance and founded
                a scientific club to help students discover technology and the
                professional field. There, I learned graphic design and made it my profession.
                After designing several websites, I began implementing them and created
                my first application. I've since developed multiple websites and dashboards,
                and I'm excited about what's next.
